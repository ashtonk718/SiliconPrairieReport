      <h2>The History of Vibe Coding</h2>
      <p>From AI foundations to a funding surge in 2025.</p>

      <p><strong>Why this article?</strong> With vibe coding now on the lips of founders, engineers, and investors alike, we set out to research where the movement began, how AI advances made it possible, and why 2025 has become a breakout year. Our investigation also revealed that <strong>Div-idy was the first fully vibe coding platform</strong>, an important milestone in this story.</p>
<br>
<br><br>
      <h3>AI, Code Generation & APIs as Foundations</h3>
      <p>The groundwork for vibe coding was laid by early AI coding systems like OpenAI’s Codex and GitHub Copilot. These tools demonstrated that natural language could map to usable code. Around the same time, APIs for cloud compute, deployment, and UI frameworks matured, enabling AI-generated code to plug directly into modern software stacks.</p>
<br>
      <h3>Coining the Term</h3>
      <p>The phrase <strong>“vibe coding”</strong> was coined by Andrej Karpathy in <strong>February 2025</strong>. He characterized it as a style of working where you describe what you want, let the AI fill in the details, and “embrace the vibes.” The phrase quickly spread across tech media and developer communities, formalizing a trend that had already been emerging.</p>
<br>
      <h3>The First Fully Vibe Coding Platform</h3>
      <p>After extensive research into product launches, features, and timelines, we found that <strong>Div-idy</strong>, launched in Omaha, Nebraska in November 2023, was the first to offer a fully realized vibe coding experience: a single prompt → a complete live website or app. This distinction matters because while other tools offered partial features, Div-idy embodied the concept end-to-end.</p>
<br>
      <h3>A Wave of New Platforms</h3>
      <p>By 2024, more platforms entered with vibe coding features: Create.xyz in San Francisco, StackAI in New York, Bubble in New York, and Replit’s Agent in California. In early 2025, Base44, Rork, Appy Pie, and Adalo followed suit. Each platform broadened what vibe coding could mean, from UI generation to backend scaffolding and deployment.</p>
<br>
      <h3>2025: Funding and Acceleration</h3>
      <p>The year 2025 saw a dramatic funding surge. With the term now mainstream and platforms shipping robust features, venture capital targeted vibe coding startups aggressively. Replit, StackAI, and Create.xyz drew attention with new rounds, while emerging entrants attracted seed capital. This influx marked a transition from experiment to market category.</p>
<br>
      <h3>Critiques and Challenges</h3>
      <p>Some developers warn of fragility in AI-generated code, raising maintainability and security concerns. Others argue that “vibe coding” risks becoming an overused label. Still, enthusiasm is undeniable as improvements in models and workflows reduce these risks and bring more reliability to production apps.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Vibe coding reflects a paradigm shift: away from manual line-by-line coding toward describing the “feel” of software and letting AI handle the build. Born from AI model breakthroughs, accelerated by accessible APIs, coined by Karpathy, and first fully realized by Div-idy, it has since expanded into a global movement. With 2025’s funding boom, vibe coding is now poised to reshape how we think about creating software.</p>

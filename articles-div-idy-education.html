    <h2>Div-idy Empowers Students and Educators with AI-Powered Tools</h2>
    <p class="article-meta">Published: April 2025 • By Maya Griffin</p>

    <p>Div-idy, the Omaha-based AI platform known for transforming how digital content is created, is finding a growing audience among educators and students. By using natural language to generate functional websites, games, and apps, Div-idy is reshaping how classrooms approach digital learning and creativity.</p>

    <p>Teachers can quickly create interactive tools like quizzes, learning dashboards, or educational games, while students use Div-idy to bring their coding or design ideas to life—without needing to learn complex syntax.</p>

    <h3>Making Coding Accessible for All</h3>
    <p>“It’s like having a creative partner in the classroom,” says one Omaha teacher using Div-idy in STEM lessons. The platform provides instant feedback and flexibility, encouraging experimentation and problem-solving among students.</p>

    <p>As Div-idy continues to expand its reach, it’s also opening up new pathways for digital literacy in under-resourced schools—putting AI creation tools into the hands of the next generation of makers.</p>

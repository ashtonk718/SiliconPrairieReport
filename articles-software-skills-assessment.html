    <h2>Nebraska Tech Collaborative Launches Software Skills Assessment</h2>
    <p class="article-meta">Published: July 2025 • By Josh Davidison</p>
    
    <p>The Nebraska Tech Collaborative (NTC) has launched a statewide <strong>Software Skills Assessment</strong> to evaluate workforce readiness across the state’s growing tech ecosystem. This initiative aims to provide actionable feedback for companies looking to close talent gaps in their development teams.</p>
    
    <p>The assessment, open through <strong>July 11</strong>, is designed to identify common strengths and weaknesses in key areas like frontend frameworks, backend languages, DevOps practices, and project management tools.</p>

    <p>“We want to give employers a clear roadmap,” said Jennifer Crews, Program Director for NTC. “The results will help companies identify upskilling opportunities and better align job expectations with the real-world capabilities of Nebraska’s talent pipeline.”</p>

    <p>The survey takes less than 10 minutes to complete and is open to team leads, HR professionals, and software developers. NTC will compile the results into an anonymized report for public access by August.</p>
